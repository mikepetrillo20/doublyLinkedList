Who: Created by Michael Petrillo

What: This is a doubly linked list implementation that I will use in future projects.

Where: This was a solo project not part of a college assignment or a guide.

When: January 2020

Why: I was struggling with doubly linked list and singly linked list algorithms questions. 
     I wanted to see if I could implement my own to see how they worked. I also wanted to start
     unittesting my own projects.
