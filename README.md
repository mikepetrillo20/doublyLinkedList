# Doubly Linked List

This is a Doubly Linked List Implementation. This was a small project to practice a linked list implementation with unittesting.

### Current Features

* doublyLinkedList.py file that creates a node class and a linked list class that can be used with other projects.
* test_doublyLinkedList.py file filled with unittests that help me find any errors I may have in my linked list.

### Improvements I Could Make in the Future
* I should change the DoublyLinkedList class to receive a value and automatically convert that value to a Node class. Right now I am only accepting Node's into my Linked List.
* I should go do research on common functionality of a doubly linked list. I built this based on what I thought a doubly linked list might need for functionality without much research into what the standards are.
* My unittests are all based on each other, I need to find a way to make them independent so that if one breaks they all don't break.

### Why I Built This

I kept receiving linked list algorithm questions on websites like LeetCode.com and CodeWars.com and wanted to understand them better. I built this linked list to help understand how to traverse a linked list.

### Why I Unittested This

I wanted to practice Unittests, this was my first time using them and I plan to use them in future projects.
